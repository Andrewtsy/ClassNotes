\section{Introduction}

Characteristics of Language

\begin{itemize}
\item[Semanticity] Specific signals, referred to as words, are tied to specific meanings
\item[Arbitrariness] There is no logical connection between the signal and its meaning
\item[Discreteness] Meaningful messages can be broken down into smaller, repeatable parts
\item[Displacement] Messages can refer to things outside of the current scope (time and space)
\item[Productivity] Users can understand and create never-before-head utterances
\item[Duality of Patterning] There is a pattern that governs the creation of larger meaningful messages from smaller discrete parts
\item[Cultural Transmission] Users must be exposed to the language to learn it (not inherent)
\item[Universal Grammar] Universal predisposition to expect vertain properties from language
\end{itemize}

\begin{dfn}[Grammar]
Grammar is a linguistic rule system that governs how we organize sounds, words, and sentences.
\end{dfn}

The structure of Linguistics

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Pragmatics] Study of how context contributes to meaning
\item[Semantics] Rules of how meaning is expressed
\item[Syntax] Rules of sentence formation
\item[Morphology] Rules of word formation
\item[Phonology] Rules of how sounds are combined
\item[Phonetics] The inventory of sounds available
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tabular}{r c c}
 & Descriptive Grammar & Prescriptive Grammar \\

Definition & Describes how language is actually used in everyday life & Describes how an authority defines the "proper" use of language \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{dfn}[Universal Grammar]
There is an inherent blueprint for grammatical rules shared across all humans and languages, referred to as universal grammar.
\end{dfn}

Noam Chomsky introduced the idea of generative grammar, the theory that there are a finite and precise set of rules capable to describe all possible sentences in a language.
